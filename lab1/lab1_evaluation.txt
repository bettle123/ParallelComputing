What I learn from 5441 lab 1.
1. I am a good TA. 
2. I should learn standard input output in C. 
    Be serious for the lab assignment.
    Be careful for submitting them.
3. I should be responsible for my project.
4. I should fix the problem quickly.
5. I should keep looking information on piazza.
6. I should response the email from TA in an hour.
7. I should only submit ".c" files.

Do not blame for others, thank for them because they spend extra time on me.
